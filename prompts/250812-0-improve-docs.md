Please make the following changes in order for the project setup instructions to be clearer, and so that coding agents have an easier time setting up and running the project.

Please review the README, and make it clear which commands are for each environment type:

1. Local environment with postgres pre-installed, and no Docker available. This is the only way coding agents will interact with the project.
2. Docker environment with docker-compose. This is how some people will develop or run the app in isolation.

Please add a CLAUDE.md according to best practices, as well as a general AGENTS.md file. Include anything you might find useful for setting up and resetting project/database state, testing, and navigating the code. Include any details you can determine about coding style and organization.
