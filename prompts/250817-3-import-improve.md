I noticed that many imports are `.js` file extensions, which is not good. This indicates either a mistake in coding, or an issue in the environment. There should be no file extensions for imports, and modules should be used where possible to maintain a clean codebase. Please review all such usage and fix them.

While doing so, please keep an eye out for simple code organization improvements.
