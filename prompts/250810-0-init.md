Please check the README.md file in this repository, and help scaffold the project. Please focus on setting up a simple directory structure using standard PNPM workspace practices. You will be the main developer on this project, so try to architect it in a way that will be easy for you to understand in the future.

The deliverables for this task are:

- package.json with dependencies mentioned in the README, and any other standard dependencies that may be needed for the project (testing, formatting, linting, application libraries, etc).
- pnpm-lock.yaml from running `pnpm install`
- PNPM packages for (at least) the frontend, backend (API and pg-boss cron worker for checking keyword trackers), and integration tests (using vitest)
- Adjustments to the README based on your changes

Feel free to add basic files (package.json, etc) for each package, or leave it for later. The same goes for standard root level config (eslint/prettier/etc).
