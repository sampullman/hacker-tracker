Code duplication is starting to become an issue. Let's start to address this by moving some backend related stuff to a `shared-backend` package. Find all common database setup code, and move it to a shared helper. For example, `packages/migrations/src/data-source.ts`, `packages/integration-test/src/setup/database.ts`, and `packages/jobs/src/config.ts` all have environment initialization that should be shared. Please take a look for any other shared code that can be abstracted and moved to `shared-backend`.

Make sure all packages are recognized as pnpm workspace projects, and referenced by their package name (and not relative or absolute imports).
