Please implement a /track route that shows a basic dashboard for tracking Hacker News keywords. There should be a button for setting up a new tracker, and a list of existing trackers with some basic information like "Keyword", "Last Seen", "Count" (number of detected keywords, feel free to improve text), "Type" (e.g. post/comment/all), and "Notifications" (e.g. slack/email). There should be a context menu for actions like "Pause", "Delete", "Edit".

Analyze the README to understand the purpose of the project. Keep the page 

There is no API connectivity yet, so leave stubs or TODOs where necessary. You can create temporary data structures with expected API/model data if needed.

Where possible, simplify tailwind usage or extract common themes and styles. Take your time and pay attention to best practices! Make sure to adhere to the existing app theming.
