We will start with a simple non-scrolling splash page, including:

- Project title (Hacker Tracker)
- Brief description of the capabilities (receive email or Slack notifications when keywords mentioned on Hacker News posts or comments, determine frequency of updates, etc.)
- Free for basic usage
- Signup button

You can refer to the README and make updates there as needed. Feel free to spice it up with little animations or relevant images/icons.
