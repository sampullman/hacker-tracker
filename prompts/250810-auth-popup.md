Please implement a signup/login modal using best practices, and maintain the splash page style where possible. Do your best to keep styles abstracted, reusable, and readable.

Deliverables:

- Clicking the SignupButton shows the modal
- Modal includes standard email/password inputs and "Sign Up" button
- Modal has an industry standard toggle between login/signup
- Include small text "Log in" below the SignupButton that opens the modal in Sign In mode
- Clicking "Sign Up" or "Log In" in the modal will later send an API call, for now set up the scaffolding for an API layer based on browser fetch.
