Based on the information available in the readme and agents files, please try to run the project and tests either via the docker-compose method or local development, assuming you are able to install postgres in your environment. If needed, make adjustments to the scripts and documentation to help make sure everything runs.

Once you get everything running, please add a playwright test to the e2e-test package for opening the home page and clicking the auth modal, both from the signup button and login text button. Make sure the modal can switch between login/signup states, and can close as well

Edit 1:
There is an animation when the modal opens, but playwright should have some straightforward ways to wait until it's visible. Try following best practices for playwright in react projects with animations.

Please add ".last-run.json" and any other playwright generated files that aren't needed in the repo to .gitignore
