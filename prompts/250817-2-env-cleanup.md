Please try to set up and run the environment based on instructions in AGENTS.md. If you are able to run docker containers, you can try the method detailed in the Readme.md as well.

Set up the environment with postgres, run the apps, then get the integration and e2e tests to pass. Make improvements to the setup and test processes where you see easy wins, and update setup instructions to be more clear and concise.
